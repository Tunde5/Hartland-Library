# Project Hartland Library

The Great Heartland Community Library is a vital resource for a close-connected community. Providing access to a diverse collection of books managed by a dedicated team of volunteers. However, the library currently relies on a manual system for managing its operations, such as cataloguing books, recording checkouts, and handling returns. These manual approaches are inefficient, prone to errors, and time-consuming, leading to challenges in maintaining accurate records and providing a seamless service experience to patrons. 
The library faces several challenges that hinder its efficiency and effectiveness. Maintaining and updating paper-based records is a burden and prone to errors, with the heightened risk of data loss or accuracy. Locating specific books is a time-intensive and impractical process, as it requires manually scanning through physical records. Additionally, tracking the borrowing and returning of books is susceptible to human errors, which can result in misplaced books or disputes over loaned items. These issues collectively impact the library's ability to deliver seamless and reliable services to its visitors.
